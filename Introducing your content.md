## Introducing your content
First impressions matter and the first page of your guide should be welcoming and informative. On ubuntu.com/tutorials, an “Overview” page should be the first step of every guide.

The overview contains at least three small parts:

a summary
a “What you’ll learn” section
a “What you’ll need” section.
The summary
The first paragraph or paragraphs of the overview is a summary of the guide’s objectives, its purpose and why the reader should go through it. An image can be included, as well as external links.

Example

Turning your website into a desktop integrated app is a relatively simple thing to do,

but distributing it as such and making it noticeable in app stores is another story.

This guide will show you how to leverage Electron and snaps to create a website-based

desktop app from scratch and publish it on a multi-million user store shared between

many Linux distributions.

For this guide, the website we are going to package is

an HTML5 game called [Castle Arena](http://castlearena.io).

The “What you’ll learn” section
This section includes the list of topics covered by your guide. It’s a way to align readers expectations with the content they are going to read. Topics are presented as bullet points.

Example

### What you'll learn

- How to create a website-based desktop app using Electron
- How to turn it into a snap package
- How to test it and share it with the world

The “What you’ll need” section
This is the list of prerequisites the reader needs to meet before starting the guide. If there is a need for specific hardware, software or user accounts, this is the right place to talk about it. If there is a need for specific technical knowledge to go through your guide, use this section as an opportunity to link to documentation and other guides.

Prerequisites are presented as bullet points.

Example

### What you'll need

- Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 or above
- Some basic command-line knowledge

## Optionally: a survey widget
You can gather some insights on who your readers are by adding a survey widget. Using this widget is not a requirement, but it helps gathering audience statistics and can help making guides better as a whole.

If you use this widget, you should include at least the following questions:

How will you use this guide?
Only read through it Read it and complete the exercises
What is your current level of experience?
Novice Intermediate Proficient
To create this widget, you need to use the following syntax:


#### How will you use this guide? 
[poll name="poll_1"]
- Only read through it 
- Read it and complete the exercises
[/poll]

#### What is your current level of experience? 
[poll name="poll_2"]
- Novice 
- Intermediate 
- Proficient
[/poll]

Note that Google Analytics is used as the survey backend.

All the pieces together
When we put all of these pieces together, here’s what an Overview step looks like:

When you are done with your friendly and informative introduction, you can start adding more steps (remember, second level titles are used to declare the start of a step) and build your guide story.

To do so, we will now go through some content recommendations.
