## General guidelines
### Mission of guides
These are step by step guides aimed at a very diverse audience. To provide a good learning experience, a consistent and didactic approach is key.

A good guide should:
- be focused on one topic or a very small group of related topics. 
- Keep it simple and on point as people who want to learn multiple subjects will take multiple guides.
- produce a tangible result. The topic is demonstrated with a small practical project and not only a theoretical or “hello world” example. The reader will come out of it with a working example on their environment.
- be short. An estimated 60 minutes for a guide is an absolute maximum. Most guides should be in the range of 15 - 30 minutes.
- be divided in short steps. Each step is practical and results in user-visible progress.
- be entertaining! Try to have a fun project to work on, even if it’s something impractical!


### Tone
The tone of your guide should be friendly. Try to make the reader feel that they’re building and learning something together with you.

All guides should have the same tone, regardless of the topic. This is why you should complete one or two of the existing guides before writing your first one.

In short, this isn’t a teacher/student paradigm, but rather friends sharing some time together. Thus, “we” should be used as much as possible, like “we have just seen”, “we now understand that…”. However, “you” can be used for demonstrating things in the user’s context, like: “edit your file”, “your directory should look like this”, “on your system”, etc.

And now, let’s see the first required step!
