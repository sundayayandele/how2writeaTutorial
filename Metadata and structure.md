Each guide is built using a single topic on discourse, under the category tutorials. [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/tutorials/34?_gl=1*17g01ai*_gcl_au*MTk1MzExNDMyOC4xNzIyODAzMDc4&_ga=2.41037794.174523528.1722802925-252670073.1722466224]

## Title of the topic
The title should be kept short (3 to 8 words as a guide) to not break the design. Try to make concise titles but also specific when possible, e.g. “Create a bootable USB stick on Windows 10”

Steps
Each step is delimited by a second level title, for example:

```
## Step title
```
A step Duration in the MM:SS format should immediately follow the step title. 
The total time will then be computed automatically. A third level heading or empty line will break into the step content.

```
## Step title
Duration: 2:00

Step content starts here.
```
Basic example
If we put these pieces together here is what a very simple guide looks like:

```
## This is the first step

Duration: 2:00

This is the content of the first step.

## This is the second and final step

Duration: 1:00

Congrats, you made it!
```
Once these structural pieces are out of the way, we can start getting into the most interesting part: the content.
